Electric Cars EDA with Feature Engineering This project provides an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on electric cars, including feature engineering and insightful visualizations. The analysis aims to identify factors influencing electric vehicle adoption, market trends, and infrastructure needs.

Project Overview:

Objective: Electric cars are vital for reducing carbon emissions and fostering sustainable transportation. However, barriers like high costs, limited range, and inadequate charging infrastructure impede their widespread adoption. This project analyzes these challenges and provides actionable recommendations to enhance electric vehicle adoption.

Key Highlights: Market Trends: Exploration of trends in electric vehicle adoption over the years. Brand Analysis: Identification of the most popular electric vehicle manufacturers. Feature Engineering: Addressing data inconsistencies, handling missing values, and enhancing data utility. Recommendations: Policy suggestions based on observed market gaps.

Dataset: The dataset includes information about electric vehicles registered in various regions. Key columns in the dataset include:

Make and Model: Vehicle brands and models. Electric Vehicle Type: BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) or PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle). Electric Range: Distance a vehicle can travel on a full charge. CAFV Eligibility: Eligibility for clean fuel incentives. Charging Infrastructure: Role of electric utilities and geographical distribution.

Key Findings: Electric Vehicle Adoption Trends Electric vehicle adoption has been increasing yearly, with significant surges in 2021 and 2022. Tesla is the dominant player in the market, followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, and Ford.

Challenges Identified: Infrastructure Gaps: Limited charging stations in some regions. Range Limitations: Many vehicles lack sufficient range for broader adoption. High Costs: Some models remain inaccessible to a broad audience due to high costs.

Recommendations: Incentives: Continue tax breaks and subsidies for electric vehicles to make them more affordable. Infrastructure Expansion: Invest in charging stations to alleviate range anxiety. Awareness Campaigns: Highlight the environmental benefits to attract eco-conscious buyers.
